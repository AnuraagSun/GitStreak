- **Custom Commits:** Type text to commit as `user_commit_<date>.txt` – perfect for daily notes or fun messages.
- **Lazy Mode:** Out of ideas? No worries! It auto-generates random C code and commits it as `random_code_<date>.c`. 😜
- **Streak Tracking:** Knows when you’ve committed, so it won’t bug you twice in a day.
- **Streak Savior:** Keeps your GitHub streak alive and thriving! 💪

## How to Set Up GitHub with GitStreak 🔧

Before you start streaking, let’s connect GitStreak to your GitHub. Follow these steps:

### 1. **Get a GitHub Token:**
   - Go to GitHub → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**.
   - Click **Generate new token**.
   - Name it something cool (e.g., "GitStreak Token").
   - Check the `repo` box (this lets GitStreak commit to your repo).
   - Copy the token and keep it safe! 🔒 (More on token safety later.)

### 2. **Load GitStreak in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable **Developer mode** (top-right corner).
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the `GitStreak` folder.
   - Voilà! The GitStreak icon appears in your toolbar. 🎉

### 3. **Add GitHub Details in GitStreak:**
   - Click the GitStreak icon or open Chrome to see the pop-up.
   - Fill in these fields:
     - **GitHub Token:** Paste the token you copied.
     - **Repo Owner:** Your GitHub username (e.g., `coolcoder123`).
     - **Repo Name:** The repo for commits (e.g., `streak-repo`).
   - These details are saved securely, so you only need to do this once. 😊

## Generating a Personal Access Token (PAT) 🔑

Generating a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** on GitHub is easy, even on the free tier. Let’s walk through it step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Go to GitHub Settings**
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click your profile icon (top-right) → **Settings**.

---

### **Step 2: Navigate to Developer Settings**
1. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **Developer settings**.
2. Under Developer settings, click **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**.

---

### **Step 3: Generate a New Token**
1. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**.
2. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., `my-laptop` or `api-tool`).

---

### **Step 4: Set Expiration**
- Choose an expiration period (default is 30 days).  
  💡 **Pro Tip:** Avoid "No expiration" for better security.

---

### **Step 5: Select Scopes (Permissions)**
Check the permissions your token needs. For GitStreak:
- **Repo**: Full control of private repositories (for Git operations).  
  🚨 **Only grant necessary permissions** to minimize risks.

---

### **Step 6: Generate the Token**
1. Scroll to the bottom and click **Generate token**.
2. **Copy the token immediately** (you won’t see it again)!  
   ⚠️ Save it securely (e.g., in a password manager).

---

### **How to Use the Token**
- **Git Operations:** Use the token instead of your password for HTTPS Git operations.  
  Example:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
  Username: your_github_username
  Password: YOUR_PAT_HERE
  ```

- **API Calls:** Include the token in the `Authorization` header:  
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PAT_HERE" https://api.github.com/user
  ```

---

### **Security Tips**
- 🔒 **Never share your PAT** – treat it like a password.
- 🔄 Rotate tokens periodically (delete old ones under **Tokens**).
- 🛑 Revoke tokens immediately if compromised.

For more details, check GitHub’s [official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). 😊

---

## ⚠️ WARNING: Critical Token Safety Warning

### ⚠️ **Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are as sensitive as passwords!**  
Mishandling them can lead to:  
- **Account hijacking**  
- **Data breaches**  
- **Malicious code pushes**  
- **Repository deletion**  

---

### 🔐 **Never Ever Do These**  
1. **🚫 Hardcode tokens in code/public repos**  
   - *Risk:* Bots scrape GitHub for exposed tokens.  
   - *Consequence:* Attackers gain full access to your account.  

2. **🚫 Share tokens via email/messaging apps**  
   - *Risk:* Intercepted in transit or leaked later.  

3. **🚫 Grant unnecessary permissions (e.g., `admin:org` for simple CLI use)**  
   - *Risk:* Overprivileged tokens = Bigger blast radius.  

---

### ✅ **Best Practices**  
1. **🔑 Use the *least privileges* needed**  
   - Example: For Git pushes, only enable the `repo` scope.  

2. **⏳ Set short expiration periods** (e.g., 7-30 days)  
   - Rotate tokens like you would passwords.  

3. **🔒 Store tokens securely**  
   - Use a password manager (Bitwarden, 1Password, etc.).  
   - *Never* leave tokens in plaintext files.  

4. **🌐 Use environment variables** for tools/scripts:  
   ```bash
   # Instead of hardcoding:
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_YourTokenHere"
   ```  

5. **📈 Monitor token usage** in GitHub’s [Security Log](https://github.com/settings/security-log).  

6. **🗑️ Revoke unused tokens immediately** under [Tokens settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).  

---

### 🚨 **If a Token is Compromised**  
1. **Revoke it NOW** in GitHub settings.  
2. **Audit logs** for suspicious activity.  
3. **Rotate all related credentials** (passwords, other tokens).  

---

```plaintext
💡 Reminder: GitHub tokens bypass 2FA! Treat them like nuclear launch codes.
```

For official guidance, refer to GitHub’s [Token Security Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).  

Stay safe! 🔒
